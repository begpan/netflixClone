<h2>Netflix Clone</h2>

A Netflix clone I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include:

Hooks </br>
React Router </br>
Redux Thunk </br>
TMDB API </br>
Responsive web design </br>
Tailwind for CSS </br>
